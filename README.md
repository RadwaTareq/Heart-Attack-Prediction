important=>zip file contains all files of the project video and html files of the visualizations plots.
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health-related parameters. The objective is to analyze the dataset, preprocess it, and train a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart attacks.

Project Contents

The project includes the following:

Figures and Visualizations: Comprehensive data visualizations and analysis saved as HTML files to demonstrate the relationships between features and target variables.

Model Implementation: A supervised machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.

Project Output: A video showcasing the model's predictions and overall workflow.

Features

Key features of the project include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights into the dataset, including correlation heatmaps, histograms, and scatter plots.

Feature Engineering: Preprocessing the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical data.

Model Training: Training a supervised machine learning model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines.
